# Python Implementation for SCARF

This is an unofficial paper of the self-supervised method introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15147).

This implementation supports scRNA-seq datasets in addition to the Open-ML18 tabular datasets (the datasets that authors used in their experiments).
